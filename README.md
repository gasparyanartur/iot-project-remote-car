# IOT-project-remote-car

This repository contains the code for my project from the course "Applied IOT - 1DT305".
The project is a robot car controlled remotely through WiFi.

This section will explain how to replicate the project as well as elaborate on the system along with the corresponding design decisions.

The end goal of the project is to create a remote robot that can autonomously navigate in an environment given a desired destination.
To this goal, the work up to this point can be seen as a subgoal.
To create a mobile robot, one must first remotely control actuators and sensors over a network.

In this project, a robot car was programmed to communicate with a server over a WiFi-connection.
This server then communicates with a website over an additional server, which serves as the interface between human and robot.
From this interface, a user can control the motors of the robot, and see the sensor values, which get broadcasted from the robot to the server.

Due to my inexperience with IOT and embedded systems, this project took a considerable amount of time; roughly 60 hours. Much of this time was spent debugging external libraries which, as it turns out, have some slight incompatibilities with the hardware I selected.
Regardless, the result is mostly functional in the sense that most remaining faults are known limitations within the scope of the project.

### Objective

When given the choice as to which project one should select, one should select the coolest one.
After all, if the self-chosen projects are not cool, which ones will be?
To this end, few areas fulfill the criteria better than the subject of autonomous robots.
The idea of creating a device that can eliminate all forms of labor, mental and physical, can be seen as a holy grail for engineers, as it would be the last problem one would ever need to solve.
Naturally, this project does not solve that problem.
Regardless, the fact remains that autonomous robots are cool, and therefore a good choice for a project.

The purpose of this project is to create a remote-controlled robot, which can then be improved upon in further work.
It is meant to provide a mix of educational moments to learn IoT development, as well as a basis for future projects more tailored toward robotics.

In practice, I believe the project provides the experience needed in order to do hobby projects in the field of mobile robotics.
Because the focus is on learning and gaining knowledge, the goal is therefore not to create a viable product to deploy but to simply gain the practical experience of creating a working system.
